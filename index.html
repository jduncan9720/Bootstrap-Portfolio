                    <p class="lead">My name is Joshua Duncan. I live in Heber City, Utah with my wife Tiffany.  
                        We have two amazing kids, a boy that is 19 years old and attending the University of Utah and a 16 
                        year old daughter that's a Junior in High School. I was born in Salt Lake City but have lived in 
                        the Heber Valley all my life.  My wife also grew up in this area so we didn't go far from home. 
                        My Dad is a professional Artist named Robert Duncan and for the last 22 years my wife and I have run
                        his publishing business Robert Duncan Studios.  We publish his artwork as posters, prints, cards and 
                        calendars.  It's been a rewarding business that I will continue but I am feeling like it is time for
                        a change which is why I'm taking this bootcamp.</p>
