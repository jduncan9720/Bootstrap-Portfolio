                    <p> My name is Joshua Duncan. I live in Heber City, Utah with my wife Tiffany.  
                        We have two amazing kids, a boy that is 19 years old and attending the University of Utah and a 16 
                        year old daughter that's a Junior in High School. I was born in Salt Lake City but have lived in 
                        the Heber Valley all my life.  My wife also grew up in this area, so we didn't go far from home. 
                    </p>
                    <p> My Dad is a professional Artist named Robert Duncan and for the last 22 years my wife and I have run
                        his publishing business Robert Duncan Studios.  We publish his artwork as posters, prints, cards and 
                        calendars.  It's been a rewarding business that I will continue, but I am feeling like it is time for
                        a change, which is why I'm taking this bootcamp.
                    </p>

                        I love the outdoors and nature in general. I am a licensed falconer and have hunted with captive and wild caught 
                        hawks and falcons.  I've trained Redtail Hawks, Prairie Falcons, Peregrine Falcons, and Kestrels.  I don't currently
                        have the time for the hobby so I don't have a bird right now but I plan to again in the future.  I also
                        like to fish occasionally and my family and I love hiking and just getting outside.
